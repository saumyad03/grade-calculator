# Grade Calculator Application
This project helps students calculate their grades in a class by configuring their desired weights for different assignment types.
## Brainstorming
### MongoDB Schema
As of now, I'm leaning towards using MongoDB to store the data for this application.

### Feature Ideas
- Assignments CRUD Operations
- Sorting
- Validation - Grade Weights = 100%

To Do
- Email and password not empty validation
- Email structure validation
- Data verification in controllers
